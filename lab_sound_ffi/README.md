**All API's might change without warning and no guarantees are given about stability. Do not use it in production.**

lab_sound_flutter is the [LabSound](https://github.com/LabSound/LabSound) wrapper for Flutter.

You need to manage the binary library yourself.

We provide compiled binaries: <https://github.com/xioxin/lab_sound_bridge>

Actions -> Select latest workflow -> Artifacts -> Download the platform you need

Or you can mutate yourself.

> if you are a flutter project please use lab_sound_flutter, which already contains the binary library
